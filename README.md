# Internal Mobility & Workforce Investment Analysis
Decision-ready people analytics project examining internal mobility patterns using rule-based personas to inform HR and L&D investment strategy.

## Executive Summary
This project analyzes **internal mobility patterns** to answer a core HR leadership question:

**Where should HR invest in internal mobility—and where should it maintain or reallocate resources?**

Using real-world HR data, I developed **validated, rule-based mobility personas** to provide **decision-ready guidance** for HR and L&D leaders on where to increase, maintain, or reduce internal mobility investment.

## Business Problem
Internal mobility is a critical lever for retention and workforce agility, yet **uniform mobility investments often dilute impact**. HR leaders need clear, ethical signals to prioritize investment toward populations where intervention has the highest return.

## Analytical Approach
- Rule-based mobility personas grounded in career stage and job-change recency  
- Training exposure and education layered as risk modifiers  
- Validation across Python, SQL, and Tableau  
- Executive dashboard and strategy deck focused on action, not prediction
- Personas validated for size, separation, and decision relevance across alternative cuts

## Mobility Personas
- **Early-Career Explorer:** ≤1 year since last job change; highest mobility readiness  
- **Mid-Career Plateau Risk:** 2–3 years since last job change; elevated, preventable mobility  
- **Anchored Contributor:** 4–5+ years since last job change; stable, low retention risk  

## Key Insights
- Mobility risk peaks early in careers and declines with tenure  
- Mid-career mobility is most preventable with targeted internal signals  
- Training modifies readiness but does not reliably reduce exit risk alone  

## Strategic Recommendations
**Prioritize investment**
- Early-career: structured pathways, rotations, career visibility  
- Mid-career: lateral moves, role enrichment, manager-led career conversations  

**Maintain (do not expand)**
- Anchored Contributor: sustainability, burnout prevention, knowledge transfer  

## Tools
Python, SQL, Tableau Public, PowerPoint

### Tableau Dashboard
The interactive dashboard was built using Tableau Public and published online.
A packaged workbook (`.twbx`) is included for reproducibility and review.

Due to Tableau Public limitations, dashboards are published before being downloaded locally.
